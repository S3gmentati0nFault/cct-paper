My "paper" for the 2024 edition of the Cloud Computing Technologies course kept by professor Ardagna and professor Anisetti at Universit√† degli studi di Milano, the paper subject was proposed by me under the title "Deployment of LLMs at the edge of the 6G network".

The idea with the paper was to go through some paper reviewing regarding the ideas that are currently being brainstormed in the field of LLMs and especially 6G development especially considering the important issues that need to be faced when talking about providing users with extremely customizable and low latency services handled by AI models.
